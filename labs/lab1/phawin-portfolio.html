            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <!-- Personal introduction -->
            <p>
                Hello! My name is Phawin Ruangsiripiyakul. 
                I'm a third-year Computer Engineering student at Khon Kaen University.
                I have a passion for video games development, coding in general, but I also do enjoy making animation for video games.
            </p> 
            <p>
                I chose Digital Media Engineering because this department is the closest department that offer me opportunities to learn both art and codes.
                My goal is to be a part of a team on the road of game development.
            </p>

                <h3>Exculpation reflections</h3>
                <p>November 13, 2024</p>
                <p>
                    In "Interactive Programming" course, I had been learning alot regarding game development and teamwork as a whole.
                    Since not only it was the first time I develop a 3D game. It was also the first time I develop First-person game,
                    and also the firt time I work with my college.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I had encounter many problem that I did not anticipated before, such as dashing into uneven terrrain can launch player into the sky, or enemy animation bug.
                    I also did not anticipated that in the persepective of a tester the game is down right confusing. And lastly there are a lot of ideas that are not into fruition
                    due to my own procrastination and inexperience, but it was an eye opening project for me nontheless.
